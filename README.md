# Proteomic-profiling-of-grafts-implanted-into-the-ovine-artery
This repository contains code and data to reproduce statistical data analysis from "Proteomic profiling of tissue-engineered, small-diameter vascular grafts implanted into the ovine carotid artery"
There are four files:
1) Output of FragPipe (combined_protein_sheep.tsv)
2) Manually filtered data for data analysis (dat_sheep_filt.xlsx)
3) Sample info (sheep_info.xlsx)
4) Reproducible R code (Code_sheep2.r)

The raw mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD036520
